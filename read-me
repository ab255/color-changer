I'm just leaving a note about an issue I was experiencing and am still trying to figure out.  
I talked to Louisa this morning about it so she does know what is happening.  
So in the phone view with the developer tools it shows my buttons as squares and I didn't think anything of it.
This morning I tried opening my site on my phone and the buttons had rounded corners.
I looked through my code and tried a bunch of troubleshooting ideas with no success.
I talked to other students and their buttons came up as squares on their phones but when they tried my site they came up with rounded corners again.
We looked over the code to see if there was any big differences and there was nothing different in our css files.
I am looking into figuring out how to fix this.
